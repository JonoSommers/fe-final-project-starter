### Abstract:
Built displayMerchantCoupons function that pulls in coupon data from the DB through the getMerchantCoupons function. It then displays the coupon data for a specific merchant to the user when they click to view a merchants coupons.

### Installation Instructions:
1) Navigate to my github profile
2) Find the fe-finaly-project-starter repo and fork it
3) Then cop the SSH key and navitage in your terminal to the directory you want to clone down the repo to.
4) run git clone <paste ssh key here>

### Context:
I had 5 days to complete the BE and FE portions of our final solo project in Mod 2. The FE portion took me one day to complete. I worked on getting a merchants coupons to be displayed to the user, hiding and unhiding headers/buttons, and matching CSS styling.

### Learning Goals:
Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
Implement CRUD functionality for a resource
Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in serializers and controllers
Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
Write request tests that fully cover the functionality of the application
Display data for users in a frontend application by targeting DOM elements

### Wins + Challenges:
One win was getting the displayMerchantCoupons method working correctly and adding some extra innerHTML to be displayed if a merchatn has no coupons.
Another win was easily updating the CSS to match the items styling. CSS is something I was confused about in our first project so being able to get it set up so quickly for this project showed my understanding of CSS has increased.
